# Boston Housing Analysis

This repository contains the final project for analyzing the Boston housing dataset, as part of the Data Science course. The project involves generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and performing statistical tests to provide insights into housing prices in Boston, MA.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following tasks:
1. **Familiarize with the Dataset**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Generate Basic Statistics and Visualizations**: Create visual representations and summary statistics to uncover patterns in the data.
3. **Perform Statistical Tests**: Use t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and regression analysis to answer specific questions about the data.
4. **Share the Jupyter Notebook**: The final step involves sharing the completed Jupyter Notebook on GitHub.

## Dataset

The dataset is derived from the U.S. Census Service and includes various features related to housing prices in different areas of Boston, MA.

### Key Variables:
- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town
- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- **NOX**: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling
- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways
- **TAX**: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
- **LSTAT**: % lower status of the population
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

## Installation

Results
Visualizations:
Boxplot: Median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV)
Bar Plot: Charles River variable (CHAS)
Boxplot: MEDV vs. AGE (with AGE grouped into three categories)
Scatter Plot: Nitric oxide concentration (NOX) vs. proportion of non-retail business acres per town (INDUS)
Histogram: Pupil-to-teacher ratio (PTRATIO)
Statistical Tests:
T-Test: Analyzed the significance of the difference in median home values for houses bounded by the Charles River.
ANOVA: Examined the difference in median home values based on the age of the houses.
Pearson Correlation: Determined the relationship between nitric oxide concentration and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
Regression Analysis: Assessed the impact of the weighted distance to employment centers on median home values.
